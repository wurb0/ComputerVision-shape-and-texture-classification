## Dataset Information

The datasets used in this repository were provided as part of a university computer vision course
and are not redistributed due to licensing and academic restrictions.

### Expected Structure

Leaf shape classification:
data/
└── leaves/
    ├── train/
    └── test/

Texture classification:
data/
└── textures/
    ├── train/
    └── test/

Images are expected to be binary silhouettes (leaf shapes) or grayscale texture patches.
Class labels are inferred from dataset ordering or filename conventions.
